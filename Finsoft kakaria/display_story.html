Budihal(Karnatka):   Kariyppa says his age can be anywhere between 45-50 years. He has lived most of life in abject poverty and used to work as a daily wager on the fields with little income to support his family.

Two years back MicroGraam enrolled Kariyppa and he was given his first loan through his daughter-in-law.

Kariyppa's life has changed altogether. He now owns a small shop in his native village of Budihal located some 300 km from Bangalore in the North Karnataka where every evening, Kariyppa sells Egg-Biryani (rice-based meal that consists of layering cooked rice and egg). From this shop alone, he now makes a daily saving of Rs 100, which he deposits at local cooperative.

MicroGraam first gave him a lone of Rs 15000 to purchase goats and construct his shop. With the support and training of Vanasiri Rural Development Society a local NGO which works in collaboration with MicroGraam, he was trained in rearing and managing the herd. With proper care and vaccinations, his herd has grown and after selling his first stock, Kariyppa still has 18 goats with him now.
